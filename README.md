# Distance Perception

This repo contains the code for both the experiment setup and the subsequent analysis of the EEG recordings.

Data files (sound files, EEG recordings) should only be stored locally, not on github. If the locally stored data files
are in your repo's path, it's recommended to add that folder to .gitignore. That way git will not track those files.
